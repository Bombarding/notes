# Notes

From now on, I'm going to post all of my notes in this repository. The notes will be sorted into different directories depending on their subject.

Inside of every directory, the files will have a numbered prefix (from 00 to 99). That prefix marks the importance of each file. A file with a prefix 00 is the most important file in that directory and the prefix increases as the importance goes down.
