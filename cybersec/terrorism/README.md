# Terrorism and Counterterrorism

This is a folder with my notes from the Coursera course called [Terrorism and Counterterrorism](https://www.coursera.org/learn/terrorism) offered by University of Leiden located in the _beautiful_ cities of Leiden and The Hague (yay, Netherlands!).

Since my notes are too big to fit in a single file, I created a new file for each week of the course.
