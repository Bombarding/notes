# Stand Out

I should stand out from the rest of the students interested in artificial intelligence by working on a code while I'm learning artificial intelligence.

The idea is to create a series of programs that will co-operate to mimic human brain in all sorts of topics. This idea is properly explained [here](https://github.com/personal-assistant/pa-wiki#personal-assistant).

**Baby step:** Create a first rational agent. Two fields. Program should observe are those areas clean or dirty and depending on the situation to clean it or not. The program should _not_ always check whether those areas are clean or not, because that is not energy efficient. It should check are those areas clean or not from time to time.

**Small ideas that _can_ make a big difference:**

 * Create a fork of 2048 and then implement an algorithm that will beat it.
 * Create a game of chess and then create an agent that will play chess against itself.
 * Create a game of Solitaire and then create an agent that will beat it.

**Note:** I should create a PEAS table (for the reference, see 01_definitions.md) for every rational agent that I'm trying to build. An example:
