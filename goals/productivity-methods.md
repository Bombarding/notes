# My Personal Productivity Method

A simple method that I use to keep myself focused and motivated. Should be enough to accomplish all of my goals for 2015.

### Use Atom Text Editor

Seriously, Atom is amazing. It helps me to keep myself organized and to update my notes repository on a regular basis.

### Keeping an Eye on todo.txt

Keeping a personal todo.txt list where I will put all of the things I need to accomplish. Keep it up to date at all times.

### Weekly Planner

I need to make a weekly planner a day after day. The point is simple, during the weekend, I need to come up with a list of things that I need to accomplish in the week ahead of me.

### "Don't Break The Chain" Rule
