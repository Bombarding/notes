# My Manifesto

I'm not like most of you.

I do not have emotions. I don't feel the same way as most people feel. I don't get hurt easily. I don't believe I'm going to go to hell if I do something. I don't believe I should be forbidden to do something I would like to do.

I'm not a role model of any kind and I'm not trying to be a role model to anyone. I've tried most of the things people consider bad. I don't think that anyone could help me if I don't want to help myself. I don't believe anyone will be by my side until death do as apart. I realize I'm on my own in this world and that's the way I like to live my life.

When I meet someone, all I see is a game. A game that I can win or loose. I don't get attached to people, all I see is a way to exploit them. A way to manipulate them to get what I want. And you know what I want? I want to be happy. And I am just that.

You wanna know why? Because I have something that most of the people surrounding me do not have. I have my mind and I know how to use it. I know how to make the best out of any situation and I'm perfectly happy in every situation I can possibly run into. I'm not saying I'm any more intelligent that you. I'm not saying that I think of myself as some higher species than most of the people. I'm not saying I've read more books than you. I'm just saying that I know how to be happy. I know how to feel alive...
