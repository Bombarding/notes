# Terrorism and Counterterrorism

This is a folder with my notes from the Coursera course called [Terrorism and Counterterrorism](https://www.coursera.org/learn/terrorism) offered by University of Leiden located in the _beautiful_ cities of Leiden and The Hague (yay, Netherlands!).

Since my notes are too big to fit in a single file, I created a new file for each week of the course.

* [Week 1: Definition and Essence of Terrorism](https://github.com/aleksandar-todorovic/notes/blob/master/cybersec/terrorism/week1.md#week-1)
* [Week 2: Researching Terrorism and Counterterrorism](https://github.com/aleksandar-todorovic/notes/blob/master/cybersec/terrorism/week2.md#week-2)
* [Week 3: Five Assumptions on Terrorism](https://github.com/aleksandar-todorovic/notes/blob/master/cybersec/terrorism/week3.md#week-3)
* [Week 4: Five Assumptions on Counterterrorism](https://github.com/aleksandar-todorovic/notes/blob/master/cybersec/terrorism/week4.md#week-4)

And if you're wondering what the hell is this course doing in the cybersec folder, it's simple: I have to understand the basics of terrorism so I could understand what the hell is cyber-terrorism and if there is a threat.
