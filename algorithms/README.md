# Algorithms and Data Structures

This directory contains my notes from the course Algorithms and Data Structures (bos. Algoritmi i strukture podataka) for the course offered by my college. Once I pass this class, I will expand it to include more data from various sources, expanding my knowledge in algorithms (since that knowledge is _very_ important for my future career).

## Basics of C

#### Compiling and executing C code in Linux

1. Create a `.c` file containing the code.
2. Compile the code with `gcc -o NAME NAME.c`.
3. Run the code with `./NAME`.

#### Hello world in C

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
  printf("Hello world!"\n);
}

```

#### Reserved words

> auto break case char const continue default do double else enum extern float for goto if int long register return short signed sizeof static struct switch typedef union unsigned void volatile while
