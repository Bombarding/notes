# Week 3

## Five Assumptions on Terrorism

### 1. Terrorism is caused by poverty

* Mostly put forward by politicians and public figures
* Lack of opportunities, anger towards other (wealthier) people, blaming the government, violence as a last resort.
* If true, then we know what should we focus on to reduce the number of terrorist attacks.
* No direct links between terrorism and poverty.
* Might be true for the individual cases, but it is _not_ the root cause.

### 2. Terrorists are crazy

* Words "crazy" and "insane" are incredibly subjective.
* Terrorists are different than mass murderers and school shooters (who are mostly suffering from mental diseases).
* If this was true, then there's little we can do to combat terrorism.
* It's pointless to try to investigate the motivation if the terrorist is crazy.
* Terrorism is a rational behavior making terrorists rational actors that kill to achieve certain political goals.

> "...it is not going to far to assert that terrorists are psychologically normal - that is, not clinically psychotic."

> "They are not depressed and not severely emotionally disturbed, nor are they crazed fanatics. In fact, terrorist groups and organizations regularly weed out emotionally unstable individuals. They represent, after all, a security risk."

### 3. Terrorism is increasingly lethal

* Two parts of the assumption: number of terrorist attacks and number of victims per attack.
* If the assumptions were true, devote more means and efforts to counter this very serious physical threat.
* If the assumptions were false, maybe spend more money and other resources on other problems.
* The worldwide number of victims of terrorist attacks per year is not going only upwards. It has its ups and downs. It is not possible to predict the future based on those numbers.
* In some regions of the world, the trend goes up (southeast Asia), in other it goes down (western Europe).
* Number of victims per attack _is_ increasing.

"The most striking development is that terrorism has become bloodier, in terms of what acts are committed and how many victims are involved."

> "Many of today's terrorists want a lot of people watching and a lot of people dead."

### 4. Terrorism is predominately anti-western

* Two parts of the assumption: the targets are predominately western and the slogans used by terrorist organizations are predominately anti-western.
* If it was not true, it would have severe consequences, such as we could make anti-western groups much bigger than they are, we could increase the struggle between Christianity and Islam, it could lead to generalization and stereotyping etc.
* Majority of the attacks in non-western part of the world (Middle East, Africa, southern (Muslim) parts of Russia).
* Muslims suffered between 82 and 97% of terrorism related fatalities between 2005 and 2010 worldwide.

### 5. Terrorism is successful

* Does terrorism create attention and cause fear? Do terrorists achieve their political goals?
* Only 7% of the time terrorists manage to accomplish their political goals. The groups that attack the military victims are more successful than the groups that attack the civilians are not.
* Terrorism remains among the top ten worries of the population of many Western countries.

"Terrorists often succeed tactically and thereby gain attention, cause alarms, and attract recruits. But their struggle has brought them no success measured against their own stated goals. In that sense, terrorism has failed, but the phenomenon of terrorism continues."

"between 1981 and 1986, more news stories were broadcast [by the three TV networks, ABC, CBS, and NBC] on terrorism than on poverty, unemployment, racial inequality, and crime combined."
