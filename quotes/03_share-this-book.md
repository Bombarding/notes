# Bilješke iz **Share This Book (2012)**

It's about understanding and celebrating the Internet culture and all aspects of open, decentralized and accessible forms of communication, exchange and creation. It's about the empowerment of individuals and the networking of the like-minded people. It's about setting the values and new standards that will prevent any kind of oppression, censorship and surveillance for future generations. It's about understanding the alternative economic cultural and educational models. It's about the Internet ecology and struggles to protect the Internet as open and free territory for all of us. It's about energizing sub-cultural groups and praising their diversity. It's about promoting open access to software, hardware, information, knowledge, science, government, design and almost anything that can be open. It's about sharing. It's about how to do it yourself.

## **Some Intro Text**

* Share conference was envisaged as a series of small workshops for Serbian activists, and it developed into a massive gathering, taking place on two different continents, with a foundation trying to handle it all.
* Twelve years after the uprisal and the social change in Serbia, we are stuck in the remains of an unsuccessful transition, with the media controlled by the political parties and purely economic interests, the subcultures on the edge of extinction, a bureaucratized NGO bourgeoisie and the rise of nationalism and homophobia.
* Under such circumstances, we believed that a gathering of progressive, young and creative people, the opinion makers of an alternative future, is important for this society.
* Every generation tends to think that they are living in the exceptional and revolutionary times.
* The public needs to defend its interests, which could be quite different from the interests of the commercial or government sectors in this matter.

## **Decentralize The Internet** (by Yazan Al-Saadi)

* The Internet is being controlled by a corrupt industry. We need to stop it. (**Peter Sunde**)
* All other sites unexpectedly decided to close down under these threats, so in the end we became the biggest site by durability and stubbornness rather than technology. (**Peter Sunde**)
* I'm sad that TPB is still needed and that there is little or no competition. (**Peter Sunde**)
* 99.9999 percent win from file sharing. The people that lose are the ones that are trying to control distribution that no longer have a place in the online world. (**Peter Sunde**)
* Look up "theft" or "stealing" in the dictionary. It means that you're removing someone's ability to use a certain item. A copy is something totally different. (**Peter Sunde**)
* The US should not have access by default to personal data of citizen and resident in, for instance, Sweden, Finland, Lebanon or New Zealand. (**Peter Sunde**)
* We want a global network, distributed and fair. Not run by any single country. (**Peter Sunde**)
* The copyright laws never really matched the public views on copyright. It's because copyright is a really boring subject and no one was interested. It was illegal 30 years ago to copy a cassette, but people still did it. No one from the industry cared because there was no public discussion about it. (**Peter Sunde**)
* Copyright is one of the most powerful tools for censoring competitions now. (**Peter Sunde**)
* It will be sharing in the future, but we should not decide already which type. It's more fun waiting to see what clever people come up with. (**Peter Sunde**)
* We all feel that we understand the US and that we actually know the country. (**Peter Sunde**)
* We need to understand that centralization is always going to be a problem for diversity, no matter how good the intentions might actually have been. (**Peter Sunde**)

## **Designing for Collaborative Consumption** (by Michelle Thorne)

* Firstly, I'm a remix kid. I come from the generation of sampling. So the talk you're going to hear is a remix of arguments made by lots of great and interesting people, notable Aristotle, the Nobel Prize winner Elinor Ostrom, Lawrence Lessig, Sean Bonner, Fight Club, Bruce Sterling, and the authors of a book that helped bring these ideas together, Collaborative Consumption.
* We want things, we buy things, we throw away things. And what's worse, this endless cycle is pitched as "good for the economy." It's our duty to BUY BUY BUY.
* The name for this unsustainable design principle is planned obsolescence. Objects designed for a limited lifetime. And unfortunately, it's the most predominate business strategy of our time.
* ...to the smartphones we replace faster than we can remember their names.
* We're buying more stuff. So much so, we can't even manage to keep it all in our homes, and have to pay a premium rent to store it elsewhere.
* Shared objects should be easy to repair and amend. You shouldn't have to throw away your entire phone because it's scratched. Building modularity means fostering generativity.
* Don't design for the dump. Don't design for the 20th century hyper-consumption. Design for things to last, to be shared, and to be part of the future, a future of collaborative consumption.

## **Here Comes OpenLeaks - How It Won't Be Wikileaks** (by Maria Bustillos)

* OpenLeaks provides only the platform for submissions, which will be encrypted and visible only to publishing partners designated by the source. OpenLeaks is pursuing a course of total neutrality. This is a sharp contrast to WikiLeaks. (**Daniel Domscheit-Berg**)
* People are just copying and pasting the news agency stories because they don't have access to the original materials. (**Daniel Domscheit-Berg**)
* It's this generation. They are networked, and they get perspectives from other people. They are citizens of the world. Like, the first ones. (**Daniel Domscheit-Berg**)

## **Crowdsourced Constitution** (by Lily Lunch)

* From Cyber Yugoslavia to Iceland, online democracy is no longer just a fantasy. Plato must be turning in his grave.
* Could a "real" crowdsourced constitution have helped to forestall Yugoslavia's own crisis and collapse?
* Constitutions are art. Law is art. Building societies is a form of art. We've just become incredibly adept at ignoring its artistic value. (**Smari McCarthy**)
* We go around assuming that the way things have been for the last five minutes is the way it has always been and always will be, which blinds us to an astonishing potential. (**Smari McCarthy**)
* Crowsourcing isn't about getting everybody fully engaged, it's about allowing self-selection in engagement, creating implicit information flow structures rather than defining explicit structures and assuming fairness. (**Smari McCarthy**)

## **Report from Public Library**  (by Marcell Mars AKA Nenad Romić)

* In the catalog of History the Public Library is listed in the category of phenomena that we humans are most proud of. Along with the free public education, public health care, scientific method, Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Wikipedia, Free Software...
* A place where all people can get access to all knowledge that can be collected seemed for a long time a dream beyond reach.
* Internet has overturned what we take as given and as possible. The dream of all people getting access to all knowledge suddenly came within our reach.
* Software is perhaps the ultimate heterogeneous technology. It exists simultaneously as an idea, language, technology, and practice. (**Nathan Ensmenger**)
* When tips & tricks of trade get embedded into the drop-down menus it's time for the experts to move on, full steam ahead: design after Photoshop; journalism after WordPress, advertisements after AdWords; photography after Instagram.
* Book lovers, avid readers, and brave researchers, learning from Wikipedia, shouldn’t give up and let the other side to control the catalog because with enough of amateur librarians the future public library will appear. When everyone is a librarian, library is everywhere.

## **Face to Facebook: Smiling in the Eternal Party** (by Paolo Cirio and Alessandro Ludovico)

* Social networking is naturally addictive. It's about exploring something very familiar that has never been available before: staying in touch with past and present friends and acquaintances in a single, potentially infinite, virtual space.
* Social network platforms are not public organizations designed to help support social problems, but private corporations. Their mission is not to help people create better social relationship or to help them improve their self-positioning. Their mission is to make money. Economic success for these corporations rests on convincing users to connect to the several hundred people who await them online.
* Facebook is not home - it is way larger and more crowded. And it's not the street, because you're supposed to know everybody in your space. Facebook is an eternal, illusory party, under surveillance and recorded for all time.
The price the guests are unconsciously paying is that they are giving away their (constantly updating) virtual identity. Guests, in fact, organize their own space, and therefore their own "party", offering the party owner (Facebook) a connected, heterogeneous group of people who share interests.
* Any virtual identity (composed of a face picture and some related data) can be stolen and become a simple re-contextualization of the same data.
* When we smile in our profile picture, we are truly smiling at everyone on Facebook.
* Almost everything posted online can have a different life if simply re-contextualized.
* Facebook, an endlessly cool place for so many people, becomes at the same time a goldmine for identity theft and dating - unfortunately, without the user's control. But that's the very nature of Facebook and social media in general.
* We should be able to unveil how fragile a virtual identity given to a proprietary platform can be.

## **Synthetic Cinema** (by Vladimir Todorović)

* Synthetic Cinema exhibition doesn’t deal with moving images that are formed as a results of chemical reactions, but it does deal with works that are created by artificial means to replicate and comment on various processes that we find in nature.
* In this cinema, we wouldn't have a need for linear storytelling, or to identify with the characters, or to enjoy natural landscapes; everything will be made synthetically, and the amount of information together with the formal qualities of moving images will all be reduced to their bare minimums.
