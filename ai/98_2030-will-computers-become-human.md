## Notes / Quotes

* **Ray Kurzweil** predicts that, by the year 2050, **_total_** artificial intelligence will prevail.
* **Ray Kurzweil** in his book **The Singularity is Near** predicts that when computer processing is equivalent of the speed of the human brain, we will have computers as intelligent as humans.
* **Ray Kurzweil** predicts a time when all the computers in the world will have an aggregate intelligence that is more powerful than all human intelligence combined. He claims that intelligence will then radiate outward from the planet until it saturates the universe, maybe around 2045.
* It is predicted that, **by 2035**, **75 percent of vehicles sold** worldwide **will have some autonomous capabilities**, such as **being able to park themselves** or **drive at least part of a trip on autopilot**.
* **Google self-driving vehicle** could be **commercially available** as early as **2017**.
* In August 2014, **IBM announced** that its _Almaden Research Center_ has delivered its True-North **SyNAPSE Chip**, a **programmable** "neurosynaptic" **computer chip**, the size of a postage stamp, with 5.4 billion transistors, one million programmable neurons, 256 million programmable synapses, and capable of 46 billion "synaptic" operations per second per watt.
* Artificial intelligence is now used for medical diagnosis and even for surgery _(i.e., Intuitive Surgical's da Vinci robotic system)_.
* In 1495, **Leonardo da Vinci** built a mechanical device that looked like an armoured knight. The mechanisms inside, mostly gears and pulleys, were designed to amuse royalty and move as though there were a real person inside.
* In 1960, **LISP** became the programming language of choice for AI applications.
* AI expectations always seem to outspace reality. Significant breakthroughs have been promised _"in ten years"_ for the past sixty years.
* After decades of research, no computer has come close to passing the Turing test, although IBM's Watson is getting better and better at playing chess.
* The next frontier for brute force programs will be to win at the ancient Asian game of **Go**.
* **Noam Chomsky**'s work has influenced research not only into AI, but also in the fields of cognitive science, music theory, political science and programming language theory.
