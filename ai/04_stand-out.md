# Stand Out

I should stand out from the rest of the students interested in artificial intelligence by working on a code while I'm learning artificial intelligence.

The idea is to create a series of programs that will co-operate to mimic human brain in all sorts of topics. This idea is properly explained [here](https://github.com/personal-assistant/pa-wiki#personal-assistant).
