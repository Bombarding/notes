# Cool Ideas

The list of ideas that I find to be cool to implement.

## The look of the PA

When asked to show how it looks like, the PA should warn the user that he needs to download some external packages to display the content. If the user agrees to this, he should be represented with the cmatrix command.

## The name of the PA

The user should be asked to name his personal assistant.

## Camera control

The user should be able to control some of his actions by the camera movement. So, for example, the user should be able to control scroll web pages based on the move of his hands.
