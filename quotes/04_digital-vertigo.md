# _Digital Vertigo_

* We would have lived our lives differently if we had known they would one day be searchable. (@[alexia](https://twitter.com/alexia))
* Rather than virtual or second life, social media is actually becoming life itself - the central and increasingly transparent stage of human existence, what Silicon Valley venture capitalists are now calling an "internet of people".
* We lived in farms, then we lived in cities, and now we're gonna live on the Internet! (iz _The Social Network (2010)_)
* (...) My job (...) is grabbing other people's attention on Twitter and Facebook so that I can become ubiquitous.
* The future is always sooner and stranger than you think.
* I update, therefore I am **not**.
* We broadcast ourselves and therefore we are (not).
* Today's Internet is the greatest spying machine the world has ever seen, with Facebook being the world's most comprehensive database about people, their relationships, their names, their addresses, their locations, their communications with each other, and their relatives, all sitting within the United States, all accessible to US Intelligence. (**Julian Assange**)
* Facebook is the novel we are all writing. (**Katie Rolphe**)
* Mark Zuckerberg uses the word _connect_ as believers use the word _Jesus_. (**Zadie Smith**)
* Connectivity will become the electricity of the social epoch - so ubiquitous that it will be invisible and so powerful that it threatens to become the operating system for the entire twenty-first century. (**Mark Pincus**, CEO and co-owner of **Zynga**)
* **By September 2011**, more than 500 million people were logging onto **Facebook** each day with its then almost 800 million active users being **larger that the entire Internet was in 2004**.
* Four out of five college admissions offices, for example, are looking up applicants' Facebook profiles before making a decision on whether to accept them.

* "In today's executive search market, if you're not on LinkedIn, you don't exist," job search expert told _The Wall Street Journal_ in June 2011. (source: _[Updating a Resume for 2011](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303657404576363612674900024.html?mod=WSJ_hp_us_mostpop_read)_)
* **Mark Zuckerberg** once said "movies are naturally social things." What he forgot to add is that in this brave new world of shared information, resumes, pictures, books, travel, music, business, politics, education, shopping, location, finance and knowledge are, it seems, also _naturally_ social things.
* You see, on today's Internet, it seems, everything - and I mean absolutely _everything_ - is going social.
* Everyone in Silicon Valley, it seems, is going into the business of eliminating loneliness.
* **Netflix** is so committed to deeply **integrating its service with Facebook** that its **CEO**, **Reed Hastings**, acknowledged in June 2011 that he has a "_five-year investment path_" for **making social central to his company's product development**.
* **Microsoft's intended** $8.5 billion **acquisition of Skype**, announced in May 2011 (...) is **an attempt to socialize its Internet business**. This acquisition seeks to leverage Skype's active 145 million users into a Microsoft centric social network that will **maintain the company's relevance in the social media age**.
* Has _Nineteen Eighty-four_ finally arrived on all of our screens?
