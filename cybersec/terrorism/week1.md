## Definition and Essence of Terrorism

Definition of terrorism (by the Oxford dictionary): Terrorism is the unofficial use of violence and intimidation in the pursuit of political aims.

Lots of people disagree with the term and there is no widely accepted definition of the term. Agreement on a common definition would be a step towards universal cooperation in the prevention of terrorism.

Terrorists usually use a different word for themselves to justify their actions: freedom fighters, guerrilla, insurgent and revolutionary.

> "Terrorism will exist indefinitely because there will always be individuals and groups that get reassurance and motivation from this type of self-justification."

> "The main education of the public on terrorism is via the media and frequent misuse of the word will result in it becoming a meaningless clichÃ©."

Alex Schmidt says that there are four different reasons why we don't have a universal definition of the word terrorism:

1. Terrorism is "a contested concept" (one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter)

2. Linked to deligitimisation and criminalisation (different organizations have different lists of groups they consider as terrorist groups)

3. Many types of terrorism, with different forms and manifestations (religion based, left wing and anarchist, right wing, individual issues etc.)

4. Changes in meaning in the more than 200 years of its existence (when president McKinley was killed, nobody in the media used the word terrorism, but today it would be unthinkable that the killing of the US president would not be labeled as the act of terrorism)

Yasser Arafat (I don't know anything about him yet) was labeled by some as a terrorist, but he is an owner of Nobel Peace Prize.

We do not live in a post 9/11 world. Although tragic, 9/11 incident was not a terrorist attack that shaped the world and we have other, bigger accomplishments. Yay!

> "Terrorist want a lot of people watching and not a lot of people dead." Brian Jenkins in 1975.

David Rapoport distinguished four waves of terrorism, each of them lasted for two or three of decades, had a similar ideology and gradually faded out:

1. **Anarchists (1880s)** - Started in Russia, terrorists used new technologies and communication tools such as telegraph and newspapers. One of the most notorious organizations: Narodnaya Volya. Russian tsar, empress of Austria, King of Italy and a U.S. president (McKinley) were killed during this wave.

2. **Anti-colonial wave (1920s)** - Groups fought against their colonists. They called themselves freedom fighters instead of terrorists. Some popular groups: Irish Republican Army (IRA), Algerian Front de Liberation Nationale (FLN) and Irgun (territory of what we now know as Israel and Palestine).

3. **New Left Wave (1960s)** - Closely related to the Vietnam war and the Cold war. They were vanguards of the oppressed world. Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) was one of the most notorious organizations at the time. Black September was the group behind the hostage taking of Israeli athletes during the Olympic Games in Munich in 1972.

4. **Religious Wave (1979 - ?)** - Islamic, Sikh, Jewish and Christian religious groups. Some sects like Aum Shinrikyo (killed 12, damaged thousand in their attack on Japanese subway by using WMD - Weapons of Mass Destruction - for the first time in a terrorist attack). Al Qaeda is the most famous terroristic group of this era.

Will there be a fifth wave? Maybe its already here (ISIS).

Terrorism would not have a big impact if people were not afraid. Their main purpose is to spread fear, so if we take the fear out of the equasion, terrorism would not have such a huge impact.

During the Charlie Hebdo attack, the journalists acted irresponsibly by broadcasting the situation live and the attack would be even more devastating if the attackers had watched the TV during the attack.
