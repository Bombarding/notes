* When the Internet and TV collide, it's not TV anymore.

Sessions:
* Ethical Journalism and Online Fact-checking
* Structured Journalism

> We no longer have things with computers embedded to them. We have computers with things attached to them.

## Structured Journalism

* Glitch.digital
* [Circa.com](http://circa.com/) as an example of atomized news, news basically based on presentations, small text, lots of multimedia.
* Atomizing cards -- basically creating standard sidebar things in Jekyll.
* Try out [Google Structured Data Testing Tool](https://search.google.com/structured-data/testing-tool/u/0/) and figure out how it works and how can we make our content even more readable to search engines ([schema.org](http://schema.org/) will be helpful).

### To-do

* Try making my blog and my website as structured as possible.

## Ethical Journalism and Online Fact-checking

What we need:

* **Exact statement** - "Those people, who didn't forget about Milorad Dodik and the Republic of Srpska, have decided that, because they have the right to do so as a part of the [Trump's]transition team, to invite me to the inauguration that will happen on 20th of January, and, in the evening, that's that call, you can film it"
* **Who said it** - Milorad Dodik
* **Where and when was it said** - In an interview on a state-owned TV station.
* **Link to a source** - [Dodik pokazao pozivnicu za inauguraciju Trampa; Ambasada SAD odbila zahtjev za diplomatsku vizu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cA1A9Jgtomg)

**Truth-o-meter:** False

**Short statement:** Only people invited to the inauguration are, as always, American ambassadors, and their escorts.

**Arguments:**

* The only people invited to the inauguration by the State Department are [American ambassadors and their escorts](http://rs.n1info.com/a218130/Svet/Region/Ambasada-SAD-Dodik-nije-pozvan-na-inauguraciju-Trampa.html).
* The American embassy in Bosnia & Herzegovina denied to issue a diplomatic visa to Milorad Dodik, stating that he was not planning on visiting the United States as a representative of Bosnia & Herzegovina.
* The invitation, which Dodik flashed to the state-owned TV station, was not an invitation to the inauguration itself, but to one of the many evening balls after the inauguration ([Faith, Freedom and Future Inauguration Ball](http://www.faithfreedomfutureball.com/)).
