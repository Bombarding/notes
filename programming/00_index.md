## Foundations

An **algorithm** is any well-defined computational procedure that takes some data as an _input_ and produces some data that corresponds to the _output_.

An algorithm is said to be **correct** if, for every input instance, it halts with the correct output. Then we say that it **solves** a computational problem.
