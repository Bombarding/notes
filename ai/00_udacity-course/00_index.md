# AI Udacity Course

Notes taken from the course called Intro to Artificial Intelligence offered on Udacity.

## 1. Welcome to AI

* An AI program is called intelligent agent.
* **Fully observable** - everything that an agent sees in any point of time is completely enough for the agent to make a decision.
* **Partially observable** - an agent will need a way to store the data so it can predict its future move depending on its previous moves.
* **Deterministic** - every action is completely predictable and dealt with in a familiar way.
* **Stochastic** - there are some actions that are completely random.
* **Discrete** - there's a finite amount of solutions.
* **Continuous** - there's an infinite amount of solutions.
* **Benign** - basically not looking for a way to get you.
* **Adversarial** - the name says it all.
