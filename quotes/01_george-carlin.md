## George Carlin

* Think of how stupid the average person is, and realize half of them are stupider than that.

* I wanna live. I don’t wanna die. That’s the whole meaning of life: Not dying! I figured that shit out by myself in the third grade.

* If it’s true that our species is alone in the universe, then I’d have to say that the universe aimed rather low and settled for very little.

* The reason I talk to myself is because I’m the only one whose answers I accept.

* I put a dollar in a change machine. Nothing changed.

* I don’t like to think of laws as rules you have to follow, but more as suggestions.

* I would never want to be a member of a group whose symbol was a man nailed to two pieces of wood.

* In America, anyone can become president. That’s the problem.

* Thou shalt keep thy religion to thyself.

* Atheism is a non-prophet organization.

* “No comment” is a comment.

* So far, this is the oldest I’ve been.

* If the cops didn’t see it, I didn’t do it!

* I have as much authority as the Pope. I just don’t have as many people who believe it.
