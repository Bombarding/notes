# Notes

From now on, I'm going to post all of my notes in this repository. The notes will be sorted into different directories.

Inside of every directory, the files will have a number prefix (from 00 to 99). That prefix marks the importance of each note, with the note with a prefix 00 being the most important and the note with a prefix 99 being the least important.
