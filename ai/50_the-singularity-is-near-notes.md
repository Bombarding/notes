## Notes from the Book Singularity is Near by Ray Kurzweil

These are the notes and quotes that I found in a book called The Singularity is Near: When Technology Transcends Biology by Ray Kurzweil.

## Chapter One: The Six Epochs

Ray believes that the entire history of universe (and the future) can be divided in six different epochs, each representing a certain period of time when something groundbreaking happens. The six epochs are:

1. Physics and Chemistry - The creation of physical laws. Combining atoms into molecules.
2. Biology and DNA - The creation of first living things and a creation of the DNA as the basis of living things.
3. Brains - The evolution of brains to the creation of first intellectual brain (human brain).
4. Technology - The evolution of technology created by the only intellectual beings so far all the way to the (successful) creation of an artificial brain. The epoch we are currently in.
5. The Merger of Human Technology with Human Intelligence - The point of time when the creators (humans) will become one with their technology to create a some sort of Human 2.0.
6. The Universe Wakes Up - The point of time when Human 2.0 is going to figure out the secrets in universe. It is believed that in this epoch we will have the capacity to "put" a working brain into pretty much anything we imagine.

> * Machines can pool their resources, intelligence, and memories. Two machines—or one million machines—can join together to become one and then become separate again. Multiple machines can do both at the same time: become one and separate simultaneously. Humans call this falling in love, but our biological ability to do this is fleeting and unreliable.

> * In virtual reality, we can be a different person both physically and emotionally. In fact, other people (such as
your romantic partner) will be able to select a different body for you than you might select for yourself (and vice
versa).

> * Most important, the intelligence that will emerge will continue to represent the human civilization, which is already a human-machine civilization. In other words, future machines will be human, even if they are not biological. This will be the next step in evolution, the next high-level paradigm shift, the next level of indirection.

## Chapter Two: A Theory of Technological Evolution
