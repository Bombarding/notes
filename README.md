# Notes

I'm posting (almost) all of my notes in this repository. The notes are usually sorted into different directories depending on their subject. The most important files are stored in the parent directory.

Inside of every directory, the files will have a numbered prefix (from 00 to 99). That prefix marks the importance of each file. A file with a prefix 00 is the most important file in that directory and the prefix increases as the importance goes down. The `README` file in each repository is usually there as the table of content for easier navigation.

**Warning:** Although most of the files in this repository are written in English, you might encouter some of them written in (my native) Bosnian language.
