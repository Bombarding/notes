# The List of the Books I've Read

This is the list of the books I have read (or at least those that I could remember reading). They're posted into different categories depending on the topic they're covering. The more books I read, the more specific will the categories become.

I'm a part of the [2015 Reading Challenge](https://www.goodreads.com/challenges/3082-2015-reading-challenge) by Goodreads. I've set my goal to 25 books in 2015. I might increase it over time depending on how much I read. I've read 10 books so far as a part of that challenge (updated on May 26th).
