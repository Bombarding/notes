# Algorithms and Data Structures

This directory contains my notes from the course Algorithms and Data Structures (bos. Algoritmi i strukture podataka) for the course offered by my college. Once I pass this class, I will expand it to include more data from various sources, expanding my knowledge in algorithms (since that knowledge is _very_ important for my future career).
