# My Thoughts on PA

In case you didn't know, PA is short for [Personal Assistant](https://github.com/personal-assistant/pa-wiki#personal-assistant), a project that I'm trying to accomplish.

It is interesting to see that we still haven't made any AI that is going to pass the Turing Test.

Although Eugene "successfully" passed the Turing Test, it is easy to see why he's not even close to the real artificial intelligence. I really think that the Turing Test is only the first step in making the true HLAI (human-level AI).

I did a small conversation with Cleverbot, as the world's most familiar bot. I recorded the conversation and decided to analyze it to draw some conclusions. The conversation is located in the same directory in a file called 99_cleverbot-conversation.md.

OK, so here are my observations.

Obviously, Cleverbot can't "remember" that he already answered some personal questions, so when he was asked again the same question, he did not leave the same reply.

But, not every answer should be answered just once and remembered.

So, the AI needs some way of distinguishing questions about himself and questions about other subjects.

For example, he will have to know his makers, his place of birth, his year of birth and things like that.

Now, to consider to be human, AI will need to have its own opinion on certain things. For example, how exactly does he decide which things he likes and which things he doesn't like? This might be a part of the programming process, but in this case, he won't be able to have his own opinion afterwards.

So, maybe why we are in the "setup" faze, he should ask us some basic questions just so he can form his personality. Once he has answers to those questions, he should be able to draw some conclusions based on these answers and to form his own answers on topics he finds interesting.

Now, the problem with this type of approach is that there is a vast number of different areas where he should be able to assist, so how exactly should we cover every single of those areas?

It is obvious that the personal assistant in Linux should be able to adjust to the Linux distro without being limited to the certain distro. How will he be able to do that?

The main question that I'm going to need to answer is how exactly is he going to update his features?

My brightest idea so far is that he should be able to download a certain amount of code needed to operate from some central server.

Those "packs" are going to need to be downloadable in a GUI (or through a console, it doesn't really matter).
