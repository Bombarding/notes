# Internet of Garbage

by Sarah Jeong

* The public's understanding of speech online has undergone a serious paradigm shift. Even in tech-centric communities generally supportive of "free speech" on the Internet, there is a pervasive feeling that harassment must be rooted out and solved. Anonimity and freedom of speech have become bad words, the catchphrases of an old guard that refuses to open its eyes to a crisis for the Internet.
* The Internet isn't breaking. Beneath the Wikipedias and Facebooks and YouTubes and other shiny repositories of information, community and culture â€” the Internet is, and always has been, mostly garbage.
* [fight against garbage] is a ranging war that the average user gives little thought to, because, well, the anti-spammers are winning. Emails go through (mostly). Inboxes aren't hopelessly clogged. The Internet, overall, is operational.
