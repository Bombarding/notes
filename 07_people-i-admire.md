# People I Admire

This is the list of people I deeply admire. In their work, I find inspiration, courage, and motivation to do what I am supposed to do a day after day.

* [Alan Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing)
* [Edward Snowden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden)
* [Chelsea Manning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_Manning)
* [Barrett Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrett_Brown)
* [Julian Assange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Assange)
* [Ray Kurzweil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Kurzweil)
* [Jacob Appelbaum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Appelbaum)
* [George Carlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Carlin)

The list is currently in no particular order, names linking to the Wikipedia articles about them. I will write a short paragraph about each and every person in here to explain why exactly do I admire them and their work.
