# Projects I have contributed to

This is the list of open source projects I have contributed to. The list is based on the popularity, from projects with the biggest popularity to the smallest projects. In every listed projects, my changes have been merged with the main version.

I'm **not** going to list the projects where my contributions were solely based on bug reporting and bug confirmations because the list would be too huge.

I'm only listing projects where I have submitted code, translated the part of the program or projects where I have contributed to by writing articles.
