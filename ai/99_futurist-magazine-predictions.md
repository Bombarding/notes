## Futurist Magazine Preditions

This is the list of the most interesting predictions from the Futurist magazine (from 2006. until now). I should probably look them out individually and update this file.

1. Thanks to big data, **the environment around you will anticipate your every move.**
2. **We will revive recently extinct species.**
3. **By 2020 populations will shrink, and wealth will shrink with them.**
4. Doctors will see brain diseases many years before they arise.
5. **Buying and owning things will go out of style.**
6. Quantum computing could lead the way to true artificial intelligence.
7. **Phytoplankton death will further disrupt aquatic ecosystems.**
8. The future of science is in the hands of crowdsourcing amateurs.
9. Fusion-fueled rockets could significantly reduce the potential time and cost of sending humans to Mars.
10. Atomically precise manufacturing will make machinery, infrastructure, and other systems more productive and less expensive.
