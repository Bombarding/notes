# Week 4

## Five Assumptions on Counterterrorism

### Assumption 1: One can recognize a terrorist

* "Looking for the needle in the haystack"
* Personality profiling or behavioral profiling
* Leads to discrimination
* Highly unsuccessful, as it can lead to a large number of false positives and true negatives
* Assumption is false

### Assumption 2: Deradicalization of terrorists if possible

* Is it possible that a terrorist can change their mind and leave the terrorist organization?
* Is it possible to deradicalize the terrorist group?
* "Former" terrorists that became CT experts
* What if someone leaves a group but not his ideals?

### Assumption 3: Decapitation of terrorist group works

* Arresting or possibly even killing of the leaders of the terrorist group.
* Widely practiced measure.
* Some leaders, especially those of religously inspired terrorist groups, play a crucial role on explaining and safeguarding the groups ideology.
* The younger and smaller the group is, the more often the groups gets destabilized.
* In 17% of the cases, it leads to the collapse of the organization.
* Side effects: strengthening the group, resulting in retaliatory attacks (revenge attacks), increase in public sympathy for the group.
* It might work in one case, but it might backfire in another.
* Successful examples: Aum Sect, Shining Path, Real Irish Republican Party
* Unsuccessful examples: Hamas, Rote Armee Fraktion
* What about human rights?

Bryan C. Price (2012):

* In the long run, decapitated groups have a significantly higher mortality rate, but only 30% ended within two years.
* The earlier the decapitation occurs, the more effective it will be.
* The size does not impact duration.
* Religious groups were less resilient and easier to destroy than nationalist separatist groups.
* Partially true assumption.

> "States that are willing to employ leadership decapitation as part of their counterterrorism strategy should target terrorist group leaders as early as possible."

> "Publicly available evidence that the [drone] strikes have made the US safer overall is ambiguous at best."

### Assumption 4: Terrorism cannot be defeated

* Are we talking about the phenomenon of terrorism or terrorist organizations and individual terrorists?
* Most of the top politicians agree that the terrorism cannot be defeated.
* It this is true, it could strengthen the idea of a big threat. It applies that we should focus on prevention.
* If we cannot stop it, then we should control the impact.

Four major reasons for the defeat of terrorist groups:

1. Local police and intelligent services (40% of the casses)
2. Military force (fight states that support terrorism??? only 7% of the cases)
3. Terrorist group joined the political process (43% of the cases)
4. Terrorist group accomplished their goals (10% of the cases)


* Phenomenon of terrorism indeed cannot be defeated. Individual terrorist organizations and individual terrorists can be defeated.

### Assumption 5: Terrorism can best be managed by a holistic (wide) approach

* Involving a wide range of individuals and groups in combating the terrorism.

Four pillars:

1. Addressing conditions conductive to the spread of terrorism.
2. Preventing and combating terrorism.
3. Building States' capacity to prevent and combat terrorism and strengthen the UN system's role in this regard.
4. Ensuring the respect for human rights and the rule of law are the fundamental basis of the fight against terrorism.

> "We have to adopt holistic approach to combat the menace. I urge police to maintain close relationship with the local community. Interaction with the community would not only provide police information about anti-national and anti-social elements but also deny criminals refuge. This is only possible if they are not feared but respected."
