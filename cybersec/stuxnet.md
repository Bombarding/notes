# Stuxnet

* First (known) software used for military reasons.
* Goal: Delaying Iran's nuclear arsenal.
* Windows virus that was supposed to end up on the maintainer's Windows laptop.
* Damages the nuclear centrifuge, delaying the nuclear arsenal.
* The attacker (U.S. army probably) knew everything about the system they were trying to attack when they were in the process of writing the software.
* They discovered that the target was in Iran because most of the compromised devices were in Iran.
* Two digital bombs: (smaller) one for the rotor and the (bigger) one for the centrifuges.
* The virus did not attack any other targets because of the specific way that the nuclear power plant was structured.
* Stuxnet can be modified so it can attack other SCADA and PLC systems (most of them being in Europe, U.S. and Japan).
