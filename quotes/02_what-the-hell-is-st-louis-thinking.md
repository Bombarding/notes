## **What The Hell is St. Louis Thinking**

Bunch of unknown authors from a book called [What The Hell is St. Louis Thinking](http://stlcurator.com/henry-goldkamp-what-the-hell-stl/).

* We all drive on, walk past each other, not really knowing who we are. Weâ€™re all just strangers passing in the street, never stopping or taking the time.
* At quiet times like this, I realize how alone I really feel.
* There is no reason to simply exist. You need to exist for a reason. That reason can be silly to everyone but you. Hold it dear to your heart. Never forget it and never deny it for it is the reason to keep sucking oxygen.
* What you do in your life changes what someone else does in theirs, and that changes everything.
* We are all raindrops. We might seem small and insignificant but together we have the power of the world.
* Fear keeps me from dreaming so I will not live my life in fear!
