# Grades

These are my current collage grades. I'm studying IT Engineering at [eMPIRICA](http://empirica.ba/) in Brčko, Bosnia & Herzegovina.

**NOTE:** `..` stands for: I still haven't passed this subject.

**NOTE 2:** I'm from a country that uses percentages instead of grade point value per credit. 55% is needed to pass (equivalent to C- grade). [Useful link](http://www.ecuad.ca/studentservices/academic_advising/grade_point_average) to convert percentages to points.

## Honorable Collage Accomplishments

* My project for the second semester from a subject called Introduction to Programming and Programming Languages was featured on the collage news section as an example showing that we as students learn practical ICT knowledge and skills from the first year ([link](http://empirica.ba/index.php/aktuelne-vijesti/464-nasi-studenti-sticu-prakticna-ict-znanja-i-vjestine-vec-od-prve-godine-studija)).
