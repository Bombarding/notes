## Week 2

Three approaches to studying terrorism: **macrosociological**,
**psychological**, and **psychosocial**.

Various studies suggest that terrorists tend to overestimate their chances of success and sometimes have problems recognizing the ineffectiveness of their actions. Moreover, sometimes terrorists may underestimate the negative reaction that their most brutal attacks could provoke among their own actual or potential supporters.

* 1960s - Why do people do terrorist acts?
* 1970s and 1980s - How do people conduct terrorist acts and who are their targets?
* 1990s - Scholars were investigating how the authorities reacted during and after the terrorist attacks. The decline of interest among scholars.

Problems:

* No general definition of terrorism
* Subjective and politicized
* Small numbers (its easier to get to a conclusion using a wide variety of resources, which is, fortunately, not the case with terrorism)
* Complex and always changing
* **Secrecy**

Secrecy:

* It is hard to interview people (which is the standard in the social reaserch)
* It is hard to conduct the participant observation (as in a researcher joins the (anti-)terrorist group and makes observations)
* It's hard to access the terrorism-related data and archives.
* It's easy to be accused of being biased while conducting a research.
* It's hard to confirm the reliability and validation of the research.

Andrew Silke (2009): The field of terrorism studies is beginning to stabilize from the biases in focus in the immediate aftermath of 9/11 and the war on terror.

Magnus Ranstorp (2009): The need for vigorous debates, critical self-reflexivity and relative analytical assumptions and approaches.

Alex Schmidt (2012): Terrorism Studies has never been in a better shape than now.

Main characteristics of terrorism studies:
* Researchers mainly focus on a very specific type of terrorism (like terrorism that uses the weapons of mass destruction)
* Based on the assumption that the terrorism is a big threat.
* Low number of comparative studies.
* Researches are biased to the western interest (instead of researching the worldwide phenomena of terrorist attacks)
* Policy oriented
